> 🚀 Just wrapped up a new project!
>
> I built **WorldWise**, a modern Single Page Application where you can mark and explore places you've visited around the world 🌍.
>
> Through this project, I learned and applied:
>
> 🔹 Vite  
> 🔹 React Router  
> 🔹 CSS Modules  
> 🔹 URL Parameters & Query Strings  
> 🔹 React Context API  
> 🔹 React Leaflet for interactive maps  
> 🔹 Performance optimization with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`  
> 🔹 Code splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`
>
> The app features a fast, responsive UI with map-based interaction and smooth navigation between pages.
>
> Check out the project here 👉 [https://github.com/Igorbraziel/worldwise]

> I’d love your feedback!
