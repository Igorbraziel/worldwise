## 🚀 Tech Stack & Concepts Learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of modern front-end development using React and its ecosystem:

- ⚡️ [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) — Lightning-fast build tool
- ⚛️ [React](https://reactjs.org/) — UI library for building interfaces
- 🌍 [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) — Routing for single-page applications
- 🎨 CSS Modules — Locally scoped component styling
- 🔗 URL Parameters & Query Strings — Dynamic routing and data handling
